# psb_bg
Checks if PSB (Platform Secure Boot) or BootGuard are enabled.
Useful for determining if you can run unsigned firmware.

BootGuard = cannot run unsigned firmware.
PSB = cannot run unsigned firmware.

No PSB/BootGuard = can run unsigned firmware (flashing that firmware may still prove challenging)
